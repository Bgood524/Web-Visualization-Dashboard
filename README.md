# Web-Visualization-Dashboard
Dashboard of weather data

This webpage contains an analysis of weather data from cities all over the world, and takes a deep dive on how distance from the equator affects various aspects of the weather. The data was pulled from the OpenWeather API, and contains over 500 cities. After cleaning the json data from the API call, we assembled plots to analyze how the latitude affects temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site contains the source data and the visualization for each factor analyzed.

For the code containing the API call to pull the weather data, see [Weather API Code](https://github.com/Bgood524/Python_API_Challenge/blob/main/WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb).
